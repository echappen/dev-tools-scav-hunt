= render '/shared/nav'

%p Using Chrome's Dev Tools panel, complete the following challenges. Every challenge can be done using the Elements Panel of Chrome Dev Tools.

%p Remember that any changes made in Dev Tools are wiped away with a page refresh, so don't refresh the page that you're working on!

%h2 1. Upgrade You

%p
  The navigation bar on
  = link_to "Hacker News", "https://news.ycombinator.com/", target: "_blank"
  needs an upgrade from that rusty old orange color.

%p Find the element that represents that Navigation bar, and give it a Magenta background.

%div.hint
  %p= link_to "Need a hint?", "https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-color.asp", target: "_blank"

%h2 2. Top Down

%p
  = link_to "Spotify's",  "https://www.spotify.com/us/", target: "_blank"
  nav bar is pretty clever: it sticks to the top of the window when you scroll. Tr&egrave;s au courant!

%p Let's make it even trendier and have it stick to the bottom of the window instead.

%div.hint
  %p= link_to "Need a hint?", "https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/position/#article-header-id-2", target: "_blank"

%p
  %strong
    Bonus:
  Let's take this website back to 2005 and "unstick" the navigation bar. How would you do that?

%h2 3. Grace Who?

%p
  = link_to "Div", "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div", target: "_blank"
  elements are the building blocks of markup. Go to
  = link_to "anitab.org", "https://ghc.anitab.org/", target: "_blank"
  and make all divs on the page have a solid red border with a width of 1 pixel.

%div.hint
  %p= link_to "Need a hint?", "https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp", target: "_blank"

%p
  %strong
    Bonus:
  = link_to "Read some more about Grace Hopper.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper", target: "_blank"

%h2 4. Turn That Frown Upside Down

%p
  Rotate this
  = link_to "frowny face", "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frowny_face", target: "_blank"
  180 degrees using only CSS.

%div.hint
  %p= link_to "Need a hint?", "https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp", target: "_blank"

%h2 5. Captive Advertising

%p Pop-up ads are the worst!

%p
  Find the DOM element for the pop-up ad on
  = link_to "this page", "https://www.everlane.com/", target: "_blank"
  and delete it! (Clicking the close button doesn't count)
